# Walmart-sales-EDA

# Summary
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Walmart sales data to derive meaningful insights into business performance, product sales, revenue trends, and customer purchasing behavior. Through SQL queries, we analyze various aspects of the data, including city-wise branch distribution, most popular product lines, total revenue per month, and customer payment preferences. The results from this analysis can help Walmart optimize inventory, improve customer engagement strategies, and maximize profitability.

# Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Understand Store Distribution –** Identify how many distinct cities and branches are present in the dataset.

2. **Analyze Product Sales –** Determine the most popular product lines and revenue-generating items.

3. **Identify Payment Preferences –** Understand customer payment behaviors and the most frequently used payment methods.

4. **Revenue and Cost Analysis –** Analyze total revenue by month and identify the month with the highest Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

5. **Customer Purchase Trends –** Evaluate customer ratings and transaction frequencies to understand shopping patterns.
